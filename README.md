# UCF Course API

An unofficial API to access a list of courses offerred by UCF, along with a list of sections in that course. Due to the limitations of how UCF's course data can be accessed, this API is currently only able to return data for the current term plus two terms in the future. For example, if the current term is summer 2021, then this API will only be able to return data from summer 2021, fall 2021, and spring 2022. As for another limitation, the data returned by this API may not be an excat representation of what classes you could find by searching myUCF.
